${PACKAGE_NAME} (1:3.2.9) ${DISTRIBUTION}; urgency=low

  * Added an epoch (1:) to the version number. The motivation is to ensure
    correct ordering between packages in /stable and in /testing without
    having to remove older packages. Previously, pre-release versions would
    have been considered greater than final releases due to the separator (. or -)
    between the version number and the label (now ~).

${PACKAGE_NAME} (3.2.0) ${DISTRIBUTION}; urgency=medium

  * Neo4j now ships a native systemd service. Options in
    /etc/default/neo4j have migrated to
    /etc/systemd/system/neo4j.service.d/override.conf.
    In addition, the main neo4j log is now written to journald instead.
